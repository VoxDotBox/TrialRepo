         Within this project I have sucessfully created a Github repo, committed changes and created branches.
         For my next trick, i'll create a simple script that does something 
         to organize my unholy amount of bird photos. Group photos via primary color of object in center?
          Request classification from user via drop down selection of breed type?
          Do none of this and instead write a script that turns off my computer every time I look up pictures of cats?
          We'll see.
